# Glaucoma-Disease-Detection-From-Fundus-Images-Using-Yolov7
This project aims to develop an advanced deep learning model for the detection of glaucoma using fundus images. By leveraging the YOLOv7 architecture, we classify and localize glaucomatous regions within retinal images, enabling early and accurate diagnosis.
